Adds a screen for viewing a list of installed mods. 
* The menu is searchable and sortable, libraries can be hidden. 
* Client-side and API mods are marked with a special badge in the list.
* When clicking a mod in the list, its homepage, issues link and description are displayed.
* The mod details page also lets the user configure the mod, if available (can be disabled for modpacks via config).

Mod Menu requires: [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)'s Fabric Resource Loader (v0) [embedded]
